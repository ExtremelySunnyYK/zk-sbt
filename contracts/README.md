# Contracts

zkSBT Implementation by [Spartan Labs](https://spartanlabs.studio/)

## Overview

There are two main contracts:

1. **zkSBT**

- zkSBT is a implementation of Soul Bound Token with zkSNARKs.
This is located in `contracts/zkSBT.sol`

2. **zkSBTVerifier**

- zkSBTVerifier is a contract that verifies zkSBT proofs.
- It is being used as an interface for the zkSBT contract.
- It is located in `contracts/Verifier.sol`
- Solidity contracts for `Verifier.sol` should be autogenerated using SnarkJs.

## Deployment

The deployment and verification script is located in `./contracts/scripts/deploy.js`

To deploy you can also run

```bash
make hardhat-deploy-goerli
```

which will deploy the contracts to Goerli testnet.

Create an `.env` file and store the following

- PRIVATE_KEY
- ETHERSCAN_API_KEY

The Contracts are deployed and verified here:
